# CSS File Repository
A file sharing repository for the Computer Science Society.

## Where to Find Files
Files can be accessed from [GitHub Pages](https://uwindsorcss.github.io/files).

## Categorizing Files
- Please place any files under the `dir` directory.  
- If the file fits in a particular folder, place it there or create a new one for it.
- Else, place the file in the `misc` folder.

## IMPORTANT - Before Committing
If on a UNIX-based system, make sure you run `build.sh` to update the `index.html` file and make the changes visible (make sure you have **tree** installed).  
If on a Windows machine, you must manually update `index.html` for the changes to be visible on GitHub Pages.
